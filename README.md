🎯 Why I Built This

To demonstrate how AI/ML algorithms can solve everyday problems like “What should I watch next?”
This project reflects my ability to:

Apply ML fundamentals (similarity metrics, vectorization)

Build an end-to-end working app with real data

Focus on user experience + clean code

⚙️ How to Run Locally

1️⃣ Clone the Repo
https://github.com/sanskarhere/PopcornPicks.git

cd movie-recommender


2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


4️⃣ Run the App

streamlit run app.py

💬 Sample Use Cases

“I loved Inception” → Suggests similar sci-fi thrillers

“I enjoyed The Dark Knight” → Recommends related action/drama movies

💡 Future Improvements

🔹 Add Collaborative Filtering (user-user similarity)
🔹 Expand to a Hybrid System like Netflix/Spotify
🔹 Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku for live demo
